# Project Roadmap & Milestones

This document outlines the project's delivery roadmap, organized into fixed-price milestones. It details the activities and key deliverables for each phase of development.

## Milestones (Fixed-Price)

### Milestone 1 – Audit & Architecture
- **Activity:** Conduct a 1-hour live call to align on the project plan, architecture, and security considerations.
- **Deliverable:** A clear architecture plan, proposed tech stack, a curated list of tools, and a comprehensive security overview.

### Milestone 2 – Working Test Flow (Proof of Concept)
- **Activity:** Develop the core agent functionality, including email ingestion, AI analysis, and draft generation.
- **Deliverable:** A functioning agent that can receive real emails from the connected Gmail account and create contextual draft replies. The system must provide visible logs or a basic interface to view these drafts. **No emails will be sent automatically in this milestone.**

### Milestone 3 – Full Validation Mode & Deployment
- **Activity:** Build the manual approval workflow, implement robust error handling, and deploy the application to the production environment.
- **Deliverable:** A validation interface for the client to approve or reject drafts, functionality to send approved emails via the Gmail API, and a fully deployed application ready for real-world testing.
