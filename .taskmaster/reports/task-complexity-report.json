			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Infrastructure and Gmail API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down this infrastructure setup task into specific subtasks covering Docker environment setup, serverless packaging configuration, database setup with migrations, Gmail API integration, OAuth2 implementation, and deployment script creation. Each subtask should be independently testable and have clear deliverables.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple technology integrations (Docker, serverless, database, Gmail API, OAuth2). Critical foundation task requiring careful orchestration of different components. Involves security considerations and deployment configurations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema and Core Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide this database implementation into subtasks for schema design, ORM model creation, migration script development, database indexing strategy, and performance optimization. Include specific table creation for emails, drafts, products, and logs with proper relationships.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving database design decisions, ORM implementation, and performance considerations. Well-defined scope but requires careful planning of relationships and constraints."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Email Ingestion and Processing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split this pipeline into subtasks for Gmail API polling service, email parsing and deduplication logic, dual inbox monitoring (customer and validation), email threading handling, and processing status management. Focus on robust error handling and scheduling mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to dual inbox monitoring, deduplication logic, and threading requirements. Involves API integration, scheduling, and complex business logic for different email types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Knowledge Base Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for file upload and parsing system, product data validation and storage, search and matching algorithms implementation, and knowledge base versioning/backup system. Ensure the search functionality is designed as a tool for AI integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity involving file processing, search algorithms, and data management. Well-scoped but requires careful design for AI tool integration and search performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate AI Analysis Engine and Orchestrator",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for OpenAI tool schema definition, orchestration loop implementation, tool execution framework, error handling and retry logic, conversation state management, and integration testing with mock responses. Focus on robust multi-step conversation handling.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as the core AI orchestration component. Involves complex multi-step API interactions, tool calling, state management, and error handling. Critical for system functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Product Matching and Response Generation System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for fuzzy matching algorithm implementation, relevance scoring system, response template engine, no-match scenario handling, and tool function wrappers for AI integration. Ensure functions are designed as callable tools for the orchestrator.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving NLP-like matching algorithms, scoring systems, and template generation. Requires integration with both knowledge base and AI orchestrator."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Draft Storage and Management System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for draft CRUD operations, status lifecycle management, versioning system implementation, and cleanup/expiration logic. Include proper database relationships and concurrent access handling.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with well-defined CRUD operations and state management. Straightforward database operations but requires careful status transition logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Staging & Validation Workflow",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for staging email generation with unique IDs, HTML action bar implementation with mailto links, web form creation for editing, reply parsing logic for corrections, and webhook handling for approval actions. Focus on email formatting and parsing accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving email generation, HTML formatting, web form creation, and email parsing. Multiple integration points and user interaction flows require careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Final Email Sending and Status Tracking",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into subtasks for Gmail API sending implementation, trigger mechanism handling (webhook and reply-based), database status updates with tracking, and error handling with retry logic. Ensure proper conversation threading.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity with Gmail API integration, multiple trigger sources, and data consistency requirements. Well-defined scope but critical for system completion."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for structured logging implementation across all components, KPI calculation and storage system, basic monitoring dashboard creation, and alerting mechanism setup. Include log rotation and performance metrics tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with standard logging and monitoring patterns. Well-defined scope but requires integration across all system components for comprehensive coverage."
