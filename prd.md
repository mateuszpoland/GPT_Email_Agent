# Product Requirements Document: AI Email Agent

## 1. Overview & Vision
This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered agent designed to streamline customer support by managing and responding to email inquiries. The agent will read emails from a dedicated Gmail inbox, identify customer needs for specific spare parts, and draft accurate responses. The initial phase focuses on creating a robust system where all AI-generated drafts are manually validated by a human before being sent, ensuring quality and accuracy. The long-term vision is to evolve this into a fully autonomous system with a human-in-the-loop fallback mechanism, significantly improving response times and operational efficiency.

## 2. Project Goals & Success Metrics

### 2.1. Goals
- **Automate Response Drafting:** Reduce the manual effort required to answer repetitive customer inquiries about spare parts.
- **Improve Response Accuracy:** Provide customers with correct product information and direct links, minimizing errors.
- **Ensure System Security:** Build a secure system using modern authentication standards (OAuth2) and contain all data within the client's infrastructure.
- **Establish a Scalable Foundation:** Create a modular architecture that can be enhanced with full automation and other features in the future.
- **Provide Operational Transparency:** Implement clear logging and monitoring to track the agent's performance and decisions.

### 2.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Draft Acceptance Rate:** Percentage of AI-drafted emails accepted vs. rejected/edited by the human validator.
- **"I Don't Know" Accuracy:** Percentage of cases where the AI correctly identifies that it cannot answer and flags for human review.
- **Email Processing Volume:** Total number of emails processed by the agent over time.
- **Customer Follow-Up Rate:** Track the rate of subsequent emails from customers after receiving an AI-assisted reply, which may indicate the quality of the response.

## 3. Scope (Phase 1)

### 3.1. In Scope
- **Email Ingestion:** Securely connect to a dedicated Google Workspace Gmail account via the Gmail API and fetch new emails.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** Read and interpret the content of incoming emails to understand the customer's request.
- **Product Identification:** Match the request against an internal knowledge base of products to find the correct spare part.
- **Draft Generation:** Create a clear and concise draft response containing the specific product name and URL.
- **Manual Validation Workflow:** All generated drafts MUST be stored and presented for manual human review. No emails will be sent automatically.
- **Core System Setup:** Full setup and configuration of the Gmail API project, including OAuth2 for authentication.
- **Backend Solution:** A backend-only application is required. A frontend is not required unless it is the simplest way to implement the validation interface.
- **Knowledge Base Management:** A straightforward mechanism for the client to update the product catalog and FAQ data.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all agent actions, decisions, and errors.

### 3.2. Out of Scope
- **Fully Autonomous Sending:** The agent will not send any emails without explicit human approval in Phase 1.
- **Multi-Channel Support:** No integration with other communication channels like WhatsApp or web chat.
- **AI Model Fine-Tuning:** The solution will use a pre-trained model (e.g., from OpenAI). No custom fine-tuning is required.
- **Complex Frontend:** No requirement for a sophisticated user interface beyond what is necessary for the validation and monitoring process.

## 4. User Personas
- **Human Validator (Client):** The primary user of the system's backend. They are responsible for reviewing, editing, approving, or rejecting AI-generated drafts. They need a simple, clear interface to perform these actions and view relevant context (original email, drafted reply).
- **System Administrator (Client):** Responsible for maintaining the system, primarily by updating the knowledge base with new product information.
- **End Customer:** The recipient of the support emails. They are not a direct user of the system but expect timely, accurate, and helpful responses.

## 5. Functional Requirements (Epics & Features)

### Epic 1: System Initialization & Authentication
- The system must establish a secure connection to the Gmail API using OAuth2 credentials.
- The system must handle token generation, storage, and refresh securely.
- The project must include the initial setup of the Google Cloud Platform project for the Gmail API.

### Epic 2: Email Ingestion & Processing Pipeline
- The system must periodically poll a dedicated Gmail inbox for new, unread emails.
- It must parse incoming emails to extract the sender, subject, and body content for processing.
- It must maintain a record of processed emails to avoid duplication.

### Epic 3: AI Analysis & Product Matching
- The system's AI core must analyze the text of the email to determine the customer's intent.
- It must extract key entities related to product names, models, or categories.
- It must query the internal product knowledge base to find the specific spare part requested.
- If a confident match is not found, the system must flag the email as "I don't know" and route it for manual handling.

### Epic 4: Response Generation & Draft Management
- Based on a successful product match, the system must generate a draft email response.
- The draft must include a standard greeting, the identified product name, and the full product URL from the knowledge base.
- Each generated draft must be stored in a database, linked to the original email, and have a "pending_review" status.

### Epic 5: Manual Validation & Sending
- A simple interface (log-based or basic web UI) must display the original email alongside the AI-generated draft.
- The Human Validator must have options to "Approve & Send" or "Reject" the draft.
- An "Approve & Send" action triggers the system to send the email to the customer via the Gmail API and updates the draft status to "sent".
- A "Reject" action updates the draft status to "rejected" and logs the action for KPI tracking.

### Epic 6: Knowledge Base Management
- A simple, clearly defined process must exist for the System Administrator to update the product catalog (e.g., by uploading a new CSV or JSON file).
- The system must be able to reload or integrate the updated knowledge base without significant downtime.

### Epic 7: Logging & Monitoring
- The system must log all critical events: new emails received, analysis results, drafts created, validation actions (approved/rejected), and errors.
- The logs should be structured and easily searchable.
- A basic report or dashboard must be available to display the core KPIs.

## 6. Technical Requirements
- **Cloud Provider:** Render, Railway, or Vercel.
- **Programming Language:** Open to developer's expertise (e.g., Python, Node.js).
- **Framework:** Open to developer's expertise (e.g., FastAPI, Express).
- **Database:** A relational or NoSQL database suitable for storing emails, drafts, and logs.
- **Knowledge Base:** Initial implementation can use a simple file format (e.g., CSV, JSON) or a database table.

## 7. Security & Data Privacy
- **Authentication:** All access to the Gmail API must be secured with OAuth2.
- **Data Isolation:** All customer data and AI logic must remain within the client's designated infrastructure. No data should be used for external training or any other purpose.
- **Credential Management:** All API keys, tokens, and secrets must be stored securely using environment variables or a secret management service.
- **Data Transmission:** All data must be encrypted in transit using SSL/TLS.
- **Principle of Least Privilege:** API scopes for Gmail access should be limited to the minimum required for the agent to function (read, send).
